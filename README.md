# ECommerceAPI
A simple and extensible RESTful e-commerce API built with Java 21 and Spring Boot. It supports product, category, and supplier management. The project uses a clean layered architecture and DTOs for data transfer.

## üìö What this is
This repository provides a backend service that stores and serves e-commerce data. It does not include a storefront user interface. You can run the service on your computer and use a browser or a tool to see and test the API.

Key capabilities:
- Manage products (create, read, update, delete)
- Manage categories
- Manage suppliers
- Clean separation between data, business logic, and web layer
- Uses Java 21 and Spring Boot

Topics: api-rest, ecommerce, hibernate, ioc, ioc-container, java, jpa, layered-architecture, rest-api, restful-api, spring, spring-boot

## üì¶ Features
- REST endpoints for products, categories, and suppliers
- JSON input and output
- DTOs to control what the API sends and receives
- Default settings that work on a single machine
- Small footprint suitable for development and local testing

## üñ•Ô∏è System Requirements
These requirements let the application run on a typical laptop or desktop.

- Operating system: Windows 10 or later, macOS 10.15 or later, or a recent Linux distro
- Java: Java 21 (OpenJDK / Temurin / AdoptOpenJDK) installed
- RAM: 2 GB free
- Disk space: 200 MB free
- Network: Local machine access to port 8080 (default)
- Optional: A web browser (Chrome, Firefox, Edge) and a tool like Postman or curl to send requests

If you do not have Java 21, the steps below show where to get it and how to check.

## üöÄ Getting Started (quick plan)
1. Visit the releases page to download the app.
2. Install Java 21 if your computer does not have it.
3. Download the release file (usually a .jar).
4. Run the .jar file.
5. Open a browser or tool to test the API at http://localhost:8080

## üì• Download & Install
Action: visit this page to download.

How to pick the right file
- Look for a file named like ECommerceAPI-<version>.jar or a file named app.jar.
- If you see files for different platforms, pick the one marked as "jar" or "Java".
- Download the file to a folder you can find, for example Downloads or Desktop.

Step-by-step
1. Click the releases badge at the top or open:
   https://github.com/yogeshy97/ECommerceAPI/releases
2. Find the latest release entry.
3. Under "Assets", click the .jar file to download it.
4. Save the file to a folder you will use to run the app.

Repeat link for convenience:

## üß≠ Java install and check
If you already have Java 21, skip to "Run the app".

Windows
1. Open Command Prompt (press Windows key, type cmd, press Enter).
2. Type:
   ```
   java -version
   ```
3. Expected output includes "21" in the version string. Example:
   ```
   java version "21" 2023-09-19
   ```
4. If the command fails, install Java 21 from Temurin:
   https://adoptium.net (choose Temurin 21)

macOS / Linux
1. Open Terminal.
2. Type:
   ```
   java -version
   ```
3. If you see Java 21, proceed. If not, install Java 21 from Temurin:
   https://adoptium.net (choose Temurin 21)

After installation, re-run `java -version` to confirm.

## ‚ñ∂Ô∏è Run the app
Use the folder where you downloaded the jar file.

Windows
1. Open Command Prompt.
2. Change to the folder with the file:
   ```
   cd C:\Users\<YourName>\Downloads
   ```
3. Run the jar:
   ```
   java -jar ECommerceAPI-1.0.0.jar
   ```
   (Replace the file name with the actual file you downloaded.)
4. You will see log lines that show Spring Boot starting and the port in use. Look for a line with "Started" and "port 8080".

macOS / Linux
1. Open Terminal.
2. Change to the download folder:
   ```
   cd ~/Downloads
   ```
3. Run the jar:
   ```
   java -jar ECommerceAPI-1.0.0.jar
   ```

Run notes
- The app listens on port 8080 by default.
- If the port is busy, you can run with a different port:
  ```
  java -jar ECommerceAPI-1.0.0.jar --server.port=8081
  ```

## üîé Test the API
Use a browser, curl, or Postman.

Open your browser and visit:
http://localhost:8080/

Common endpoints (use these as examples)
- GET all products:
  http://localhost:8080/api/products
- GET a product by id:
  http://localhost:8080/api/products/{id}
- GET all categories:
  http://localhost:8080/api/categories
- GET all suppliers:
  http://localhost:8080/api/suppliers
- Health check (if provided):
  http://localhost:8080/actuator/health

Using curl (example)
```
curl http://localhost:8080/api/products
```
This command shows the JSON the API returns.

## üõ†Ô∏è Common issues and fixes
"java -version" returns an older Java
- Install Java 21 and set it as default.
- Restart your terminal after install.

Error: Address already in use
- Another app uses port 8080.
- Run the jar with a different port:
  ```
  java -jar ECommerceAPI-1.0.0.jar --server.port=8082
  ```

The API returns 404 on a path
- Check the path spelling.
- Confirm the app started without errors in the terminal.

App does not start, shows errors in log
- Look for lines marked ERROR or Exception.
- Copy the error text and search the repository Issues or the web.
- If you cannot find a solution, share the error text when you ask for help.

JSON response looks complex
- The API sends and receives JSON. Use a browser extension or Postman to view it more clearly.

## ‚ùì FAQ
Q: Do I need a database?
A: The release often includes an embedded database or an in-memory database for local use. The app works out of the box for testing. For production, you will need a real database and a small configuration change.

Q: Can I run this on a server?
A: Yes. Use the same jar on a server with Java 21. Configure database and ports as needed.

Q: Is there a web UI?
A: This project provides a backend API. You can build a frontend that calls the endpoints.

Q: How do I stop the app?
A: In the terminal, press Ctrl+C to stop the running process.
